## Technical Case Study Implementation Strategy

### 1. Team Structuring & Task Allocation

#### Frontend Architecture Design
```
Frontend Architecture Overview:
├── Core Framework: React with TypeScript + Tanstack router + tanstack form
├── State Management: Zustand + Context
├── UI Components
│   ├── Component Library: Mantine UI + Mantine Hooks
│   ├── Custom Components
│   └── Custom Hooks
├── API Integration Layer
│   ├── REST Client
│   └── GraphQL Integration
├── Testing Framework
│   ├── Vitest
│   └── Playwright
└── Build/Deploy Pipeline
	├── Vite
	└── CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
```

#### Task Distribution Strategy

**Senior Developers(1)**
- Architecture implementation and core infrastructure
- Complex feature development
- Code review leadership
- Technical mentorship

**Mid-Level Developers(2)**
- Feature implementation
- Component development
- Integration with backend services
- Unit test creation

**Junior Developers(2)**
- UI component development
- Documentation
- Bug fixes
- Test coverage improvement

### 2. Workflow Management

#### Agile Implementation
- **Framework**: Scrum with 2-week sprints
- **Daily Activities**:
  - 15-minute stand-ups at 10:00 AM
  - Async updates in Slack for remote team members
  - End-of-day blockers channel update

#### Tools Stack
- Jira: Project management and ticket tracking
- GitHub: Version control and code reviews
- Confluence: Documentation and knowledge base
- Slack: Team communication
- Figma: Design collaboration

#### Blocker Resolution Process
1. Developer identifies blocker
2. Posts in #blockers Slack channel
3. Tech Lead assesses within 30 minutes
4. If unresolved in 2 hours, escalation to architecture team
5. Daily blocker review in stand-ups

### 3. Quality Assurance & Reviews

#### Code Quality Framework
1. **Pre-commit Checks**
   - ESLint configuration
   - Prettier formatting
   - TypeScript strict mode
   - Unit test coverage minimum 80%

2. **Code Review Process**
   - PR template enforcement
   - Two approvals required
   - Tech Lead final review for critical components
   - Maximum 24-hour review turnaround

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - Unit tests: Vitest + React Testing Library
   - Integration tests: Cypress
   - E2E tests for critical paths
   - Performance testing with Lighthouse

4. **Best Practices Enforcement**
   - Automated style guide checks
   - Regular architecture review sessions
   - Weekly tech debt review
   - Monthly architecture evolution meetings

### 4. Timeline & Milestones

#### Week 1-2: Foundation
- Project setup and architecture
- Core component library
- Basic CI/CD pipeline
- Team onboarding

#### Week 3-4: Core Development
- Authentication implementation
- Main feature development starts
- API integration layer
- Basic testing framework

#### Week 5-6: Feature Implementation
- Primary features completion
- Integration testing
- Performance optimization
- Initial QA round

#### Week 7-8: Refinement
- Bug fixes and optimization
- Documentation completion
- Final testing
- Deployment preparation

#### Key Deliverables Timeline
```
Week 1: Project Setup & Architecture Design
Week 2: Core Infrastructure
Week 3: Authentication & Base Features
Week 4: Main Feature Set - Phase 1
Week 5: Main Feature Set - Phase 2
Week 6: Integration & Testing
Week 7: Optimization & Bug Fixes
Week 8: Final Testing & Deployment
```

### Risk Mitigation Strategies

1. **Technical Risks**
   - Regular architecture reviews
   - Spike solutions for complex features
   - Technical debt monitoring

2. **Team Risks**
   - Cross-training sessions
   - Knowledge sharing meetings
   - Detailed documentation requirements

3. **Timeline Risks**
   - Buffer time in sprint planning
   - Weekly progress assessments
   - Flexible resource allocation
